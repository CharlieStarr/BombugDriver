# BombugDriver
**This is a school project** 

The Bombug Driver is a bundle of C++ and Python code for controlling a Bombug device.

## Technologies
Project made with:
* [Arduino UNO](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/uno-rev3/)
* [Python 3.10.5](https://www.python.org/)
* [Pygame 2.1.2](https://www.pygame.org/docs/index.html)
* [Pyserial 3.5](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/)

## Instalation
Before installing any code make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

* [Arduino IDE 1.8.19 or above](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
* [Python 3.10.5 or above](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Pip 24.2 or above](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

### 1. Setting up the Bombug folder
Clone the github repository to any folder you like. After that you have to upload the `radio_emitter` and `radio_reciever` to your Bombug device and Arduino UNO respectively and make sure they are running. Take note of what port your Arduino is using as it will be important later.
### 2. Adding the RadioHead library
You will have to install the [RadioHead](https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/) library and manually add it to your libraries in the Arduino IDE to make sure the code works.
### 3. Installing relevant python modules
You will have to install the `pygame` and `pyserial` modules if you do not have them already:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
and 
```bash
pip install pyserial
```
## Usage
Double click on the batch file to start running the program. You will se 2 windows, one is the command prompt and the other is the graphics window. By heading over to the command prompt you will se something like this:
```
Running Bombug python code and dependencies.
pygame 2.1.2 (SDL 2.0.18, Python 3.10.5)
Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
COM7 - Arduino Uno (COM7)
COM3 - Arduino Uno (COM3)
Select port: COM_
```
You must then input the serial port the recieving Arduino is using, and after that you will be seing the images captured by the Bombug device on the second window.

## Configuring (VERY optional)
### Modifying display variables
In the ``radar.py`` file you can find various variables written in all-caps. Most of these can be modify to suit whatever needs you have, either with the Bombug device or in general any visual preferences you might have:[^1]
```python
HEIGHT = 800 # Dimentions of the display window
WIDTH = 1200
FPS = 60
```
```python
TRUESIZE = 20       # Defines size of to-be-displayed object (in cm)
MAXSENSOR = 320     # Defines max-distance that the sensor can meassure (in cm)
SIZING = 5          # Defines a constant to convert acual cm meassures to pixels
SENSORDISTANCE = 5  # Defines distance betwen ultrasonic sensors (in cm)
```
[^1]:You _can_ change ``TRUESIZE``, ``MAXSENSOR``, and ``SENSORDISTANCE`` but these are calibrated specifically for the Bombug device. If yours does not match the afforementioned values then you should change them. Personally I would not recommend changing ``FPS`` because it really does not do much to increase fluidity and I do not know your computer's specifications.

### Adding custom displayable shapes
You can find the shapes that the program can read in ``object.py``. To add another shape you must create a list of 3d points that define the coordenates of the shape relative to a center point:
```python
exampleSquare = [(1, 1, 0), (-1, 1, 0), (-1, -1, 0), (1, -1, 0)]
```
You can even add more shapes to make a full 3d object:[^2] 
```python
# Example Cube
exampleSquare1 = [(1, 1, 0), (-1, 1, 0), (-1, -1, 0), (1, -1, 0)]
exampleSquare2 = [(1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 0), (1, -1, 0), (1, -1, 1)]
exampleSquare3 = [(-1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 0), (-1, 1, 0)]
exampleSquare4 = [(-1, 1, 1), (-1, 1, 0), (-1, -1, 0), (-1, -1, 1)]
exampleSquare5 = [(-1, -1, 1), (1, -1, 1), (1, -1, 0), (-1, -1, 0)]
```
[^2]:As of writing this ``Nodes`` and ``Faces`` are handeled by their own class, while 3d objects are just an array of ``Faces``. While this allows for changing the properties of each face individualy I'm still debating if changing it to make it easier to load 3d objects.

To load custom shapes onto the Bombug software you will have to modify the loading section in ``radar.py`` and add your shapes and their respective color:[^3]
```python
# Loads faces and colors to create the to-be-displayed object (check objects.py for more info)
faceList = [ob.exampleSquare3, ob.exampleSquare2, ob.exampleSquare1]
colorList = [(0, 255, 0), (255, 0, 255), (255, 0, 0)]
```
[^3]: The shapes described in this example are the ones loaded by default by the program, although under a different name.

Note that the last shape writen is the one that will appear on top. This is because the program loads the first ones first and the next on top of them.


## Status
Bombug v0.0.1 developed and maintained by Carlos â˜…
### Features:
- Can **see**
- Can see multiple different customizable shapes
### To Do:
- Add log functionality for storing and sharing visual data
- Add the toy car and program it? (I'm not the one working on that anyway)
- Add sentience
